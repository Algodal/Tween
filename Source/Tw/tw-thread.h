/// @brief Creates a Thread and assigns it to the Instance of the Tween.
///        A thread is expected to be created once per instance. 
///        Multiple thread behavior is undefined.
///        The purpose of the Thread is the update the Tween automatically
///        without by calling @ref Tw_Update for you.  In order
///        for the thread to know how to update the Tween, you will have
///        to provide it with the update rate and the duration.
///        @attention The Thread begins running immediately after this function is called.
/// @param i Tween Instance
/// @param update_rate The update rate is the number of times @ref Tw_Update
///                    is to be called per second.  This can be any amount
///                    you choose.  The higher the value the more smooth
///                    the tweening will be but more processing power required so
///                    use your descretion.  A reccommended approach is to match the 
///                    frame rate of your game (if you are making a game) or other
///                    established frame rate such as 60, 30, 24 etc.
/// @param duration This how long in seconds you want the tweening to spread out.
///                 The Tween will last this long in time from inital value to final value.
/// @param function This optional function provides feedback on the thread process via @ref Tw_ThreadFunctionParam.
///                 You can also post requests to the thread as well via @ref Tw_ThreadFunctionRequest
/// @param loop     This optional value indicates if you want the thread to loop.
///                 Looping occurs when the Tween is completed.  The thread will reset
///                 the Tween and run it again.  A thread that has loop set will never stop.
///                 In order to stop such a thread you will have to use @ref Tw_SetThreadLoop
///                 and set the value to @ref TW_LOOP_NONE.
/// @return True if the thread was created successfully.
