/// @brief Creates a Thread and assigns it to the Instance of the Tween.
///        One Tween Instance can have only one Thread at at anytime.
///        DO NOT - Create Multiple Threads for a Instance at the Same time.
///        The purpose of the Thread is the update the Tween automatically
///        without calling @ref Tw_Update manually in a loop.  In order
///        for the thread to know how to update the Tween, you will have
///        to provide it with the update rate and the duration.
///        The Thread begins running immediately after this function is called.
/// @param i Tween Instance
/// @param update_rate The update rate is the number of times @ref Tw_Update
///                    is to be called per second.  This can be any amount
///                    you chose.  The higher the value the more smooth
///                    the tweening will be but more processing power required so
///                    Use your descetion.  A recommend approach is to match the 
///                    frame rate of your game (if you are making a game) or other
///                    established frame rate such as 60, 30, 24 etc.
/// @param duration This how long in seconds you want the tweening to spread out.
///                 The Tween will last this long in time from inital value to final value.
/// @param function This is a generic function that you may optionally pass to the 
///                 Thread.  It is called after @ref Tw_Update and is passed the 
///                 current value of the Tween and the current time the Tween has
///                 been running.
